# smart-fuel-routing
This project is a Django-based API that helps plan road trips across the USA in the most cost-effective way. It finds the best route, suggests where to refuel based on fuel prices and a 500-mile vehicle range, and calculates the total fuel cost assuming 10 MPG. It’s built to be fast, efficient, and production-ready.
